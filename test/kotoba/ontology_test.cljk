;; --- the caller-supplied-registry arities -----------------------------------
;;
;; Every test above calls the 0-/1-arity forms, which close over the seeded
;; `registry` var. That means they cannot distinguish "the function reads the
;; registry it was handed" from "the function ignores its argument and reads
;; the seeded one" -- rewriting `(object-types reg)` to `(object-types
;; registry)` inside `by-id` leaves them all green. The extra arity is the
;; library's entire extensibility story (a blueprint registers its own object
;; types and passes them in), so it needs a registry the seeded one could not
;; be mistaken for: disjoint ids, and a type whose id the seeded table lacks.
