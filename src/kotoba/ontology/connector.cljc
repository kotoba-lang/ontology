  "Registry of external-data connectors, and the pure step that tags a
  normalized fact with ontology provenance before it lands in a
  cloud-itonami-* activity/artifact graph.

  Fetch/parse stays where kotoba-lang/goyoukiki already put it: a per-source
  JVM-only adapter (goyoukiki.jp.kkj, goyoukiki.jp.geps) that does the actual
  HTTP call and maps the raw response to the domain's own pure-data model.
  This namespace does not fetch anything — it only records which connectors
  exist, what object type they produce, and how to stamp their output with
  :ontology/* provenance so it can be told apart from every other source."
