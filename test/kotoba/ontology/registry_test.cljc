  "Integrity of the two seeded registries *as data*.

  `kotoba.ontology` and `kotoba.ontology.connector` are registries: their
  value is the table, not the four lookup functions over it. Every function
  test in this repo passes `:tender` / `:jp.kkj` by hand, so it proves the
  lookups work on rows it names itself — it cannot notice a row that is
  wrong, and it cannot notice a row added later that is wrong.

  The failure this guards against is silent by construction. A connector
  whose `:object-type` is misspelled still resolves, `tag` still stamps the
  misspelling, and `tagged-conforms?` then returns `false` for every fact
  that source ever produces — which is indistinguishable, from the caller's
  side, from facts that genuinely do not conform. Nothing throws and nothing
  logs; the connector simply never validates again.

  So these assert properties of the tables, and they are the tests that have
  to grow when a row is added."
